## Why Actionbook?

### ❌ Without Actionbook

- **Slow.** Agents take a snapshot after every single step, parse the page, then decide what to do next. Searching one room on Airbnb takes 15 minutes.
- **Brittle.** Modern websites use virtual DOMs, streaming components, and SPAs. Agents don't understand these rendering mechanisms, so they fail to interact with dropdowns, date pickers, and dynamic content.
- **One at a time.** Your agent finishes one page before it can start the next. Need to check 30 company websites? That's 30 rounds, one after another.

### ✅ With Actionbook

- **10x faster.** Action manuals tell agents exactly what to do. No parsing, no guessing.
- **Accurate.** Built for virtual DOMs, SPAs, and streaming components. Agents operate reliably.
- **Concurrent.** Stateless architecture. Operate dozens of tabs in parallel.

An agent collects taglines from 192 First Round portfolio companies in 2 minutes.

## Quick Start

Get started with Actionbook in under 2 minutes:

**Step 1: Install the CLI**

macOS / Linux
```bash
curl -fsSL https://actionbook.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell)
```
irm https://actionbook.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

The Rust-based CLI uses your existing system browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, Chromium), so no extra browser install step is required.

**Step 2: Use with any AI Agent**

When working with any AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), add this to your prompt:

```
Use Actionbook to understand and operate the web page.
```

The agent will automatically use the CLI to fetch action manuals and execute browser operations.

**Step 3 (Optional): Add the Skill**

For enhanced agent integration, add the Actionbook skill:

```bash
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://actionbook.dev/install.sh | bash
