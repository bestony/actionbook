## The Problem

When you ask Claude Code to "write a scraper for X website", it needs to figure out:

- What CSS selectors to use
- How the page structure works
- How to handle dynamic content
- Which elements contain the data you need

**Without Actionbook**, Claude Code has to guess selectors based on common patterns, often resulting in:

- Wrong or fragile selectors
- Missing data fields
- Scripts that break when the page structure changes
- Multiple rounds of trial and error

**With Actionbook**, Claude Code gets verified selectors and page structure directly, generating working scripts on the first try.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Actionbook

**Install via plugin**

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add actionbook/actionbook
claude plugin install actionbook@actionbook-marketplace
```

**Install manually**

```sh
claude mcp add actionbook -- npx -y @actionbookdev/mcp@latest
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```

### 2. Add to Your Prompt

When asking Claude Code to write a scraper, add this to your prompt:

```
Use Actionbook to understand the page before taking action.
```

That's it! Claude Code will automatically query Actionbook for verified selectors and page structure.
