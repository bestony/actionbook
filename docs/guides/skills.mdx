Skills give your AI agent reusable instructions for how to use Actionbook correctly.

## Install Actionbook skills

Use the Actionbook skills package:

```bash
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```

In the interactive flow, choose the skill you want to install (for example `actionbook` or `active-research`). If you need both, run the same command again and select the other skill.

## What each skill does

### `actionbook/actionbook`

Core browser-operation workflow for agents:

- `actionbook search` to find relevant manuals
- `actionbook get` to fetch verified selectors
- execute browser actions with less selector guesswork

### `actionbook/active-research`

Research workflow for deep analysis and report generation:

- structured multi-source collection
- selector-aware browsing with Actionbook
- output-ready report workflow for long-form research

## Example prompt

```text
Use Actionbook skill workflow: search first, then get the best manual, then execute browser actions.
```
