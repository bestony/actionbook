Actionbook provides three integration methods, with the CLI being the primary and recommended way for most users.

| Method | Best For | Installation Time |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **CLI (Recommended)** | AI agents, browser automation, command line | < 1 minute |
| **MCP Server** | AI IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code) | < 1 minute |
| **JavaScript SDK** | Custom agents, programmatic integration | < 2 minutes |

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- <Icon icon="check" color="#22c55e" /> **Node.js** >= v18.0.0 ([Download](https://nodejs.org))

<Tip>
  Check your Node.js version with `node --version`
</Tip>

<Note>
  Actionbook is currently in open beta. No API key required!
</Note>

## CLI Installation (Recommended)

Install the CLI globally to use Actionbook anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
```

The Rust-based CLI uses your existing system browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, Chromium), so no extra browser install step is required.

Once installed, you can use the `actionbook` command directly or let your AI agent use it.

## Skill Installation

To enhance your AI agent's capabilities with Actionbook, add the skill to your project:

```bash
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```
