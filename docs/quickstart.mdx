Get started with Actionbook in under 2 minutes using the CLI.

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Install the CLI globally to use Actionbook from the command line or with any AI agent.

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
```

The Rust-based CLI uses your existing system browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, Chromium), so no extra browser install step is required.

## Step 2: Use with Any AI Agent

When working with any AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), simply add this to your prompt:

```text
Use Actionbook to understand and operate the web page.
```

The agent will automatically use the CLI to fetch action manuals and execute browser operations.

## Step 3: Add the Skill (Optional)

For enhanced integration with AI agents, adding the Actionbook skill is recommended:

```bash
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```

This installs the skill configuration directly into your project's `.skills` or `.agent` directory, allowing agents to better understand how to use Actionbook's capabilities.
