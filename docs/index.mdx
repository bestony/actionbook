## Why Actionbook?

### <Icon icon="xmark" color="#ef4444" /> Without Actionbook

Building reliable browser agents is difficult and expensive:

- **Slow Execution:** Agents waste time parsing full HTML pages to find elements
- **High Token Costs:** Sending entire DOM trees to LLMs consumes massive context windows
- **Brittle Selectors:** Updates to website UIs break hardcoded selectors and agent logic immediately
- **Hallucinations:** LLMs often guess incorrect actions when faced with complex, unstructured DOMs

### <Icon icon="check" color="#22c55e" /> With Actionbook

Actionbook places up-to-date action manuals with the relevant DOM selectors directly into your LLM's context:

- **10x Faster:** Agents access pre-computed "Action manuals" to know exactly what to do without exploring
- **100x Token Savings:** Instead of whole HTML page, agents receive only related DOM elements in concise, semantic JSON definitions
- **Resilient Automation:** Action manuals are maintained and versioned. If a site changes, the manual is updated, not your agent
- **Universal Compatibility:** Works with any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) and any AI operator framework

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Requests Action" icon="robot">
    Your AI agent calls Actionbook MCP tools like `search_actions` or `get_action_by_id` to find the action it needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Actionbook Retrieves Manual" icon="book">
    Actionbook looks up the pre-verified action manual from its database, containing precise selectors and operation methods.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Executes Precisely" icon="bullseye">
    Your agent receives clean, structured action data and executes the operation with confidence - no guessing, no hallucinations.
  </Step>
