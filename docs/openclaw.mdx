---

Use this guide to connect Actionbook to OpenClaw from a clean setup.

This flow is **CLI + Skills only** (no MCP path).

## Step 1: Install Actionbook CLI

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
actionbook --version
```

## Step 2: Run `actionbook setup` (install Skills for OpenClaw)

Run setup:

```bash
actionbook setup
```

During setup, make sure you install Skills to **OpenClaw global**.

After setup, verify `actionbook` is ready in OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw skills check
```

Also run a quick CLI smoke test before changing OpenClaw browser config:

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search listings tokyo" --domain airbnb.com
```

You should see at least one result with an `ID`.

## Step 3: Disable OpenClaw default browser + force Actionbook for browser work

Disable OpenClaw browser tool and restart gateway:

```bash
openclaw config set browser.enabled false --json
openclaw config set tools.deny '["browser"]' --json
openclaw gateway restart
```

Rollback (if you need to restore built-in browser later):

```bash
openclaw config set browser.enabled true --json
openclaw config set tools.deny '[]' --json
openclaw gateway restart
```

If you already use other `tools.deny` rules, remove only `"browser"` from that array instead of resetting it to `[]`.

Then add an instruction in the canonical OpenClaw instruction file `~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md`:

```markdown
## Browser automation preference
- Use Actionbook CLI for all website/browser operations.
- Do not use the built-in OpenClaw browser tool unless explicitly asked.
- Follow: `actionbook search` -> `actionbook get` -> operate.
```

## Try it

Ask OpenClaw:

```text
Use Actionbook in CLI + Skills mode: search first, then get the most relevant manual, then give me the exact selectors and field values to execute.
```
