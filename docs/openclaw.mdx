Use this guide to connect Actionbook to OpenClaw from a clean setup.

## Step 1: Install Actionbook CLI

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
actionbook --version
```

The CLI is the base integration path and a reliable fallback even when MCP is enabled.

## Step 2: Verify Actionbook Works

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search listings tokyo" --domain airbnb.com
```

You should get at least one result with an `ID`.

## Step 3: Configure Actionbook MCP for OpenClaw

OpenClaw uses `mcporter` to connect MCP servers.

```bash
npm install -g mcporter
mcporter config add actionbook npx --args -y --args @actionbookdev/mcp@latest
```

If your MCP client requires an explicit API key, add it while registering the server:

```bash
mcporter config add actionbook npx \
  --args -y \
  --args @actionbookdev/mcp@latest \
  --env ACTIONBOOK_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Validate the server and tools:

```bash
mcporter list actionbook --schema
mcporter call actionbook.search_actions query="airbnb search listings tokyo"
```

## Step 4: Check OpenClaw Skill Readiness

```bash
openclaw skills check
```

Make sure both `actionbook` and `mcporter` appear under `Ready to use`. If not, install missing binaries and reload the gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Step 5: Use Actionbook from OpenClaw

Ask OpenClaw:

```text
Use Actionbook to find the best action manual for Airbnb search, then explain which selectors to click and fill.
```

For MCP-first workflows, ask OpenClaw to call `mcporter` with Actionbook MCP tools before continuing with Actionbook CLI/browser commands.
