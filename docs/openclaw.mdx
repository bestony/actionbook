---

Use this guide to connect Actionbook to OpenClaw from a clean setup.

This flow is **CLI + Skills only** (no MCP path).

## Step 1: Install Actionbook CLI

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
actionbook --version
```

## Step 2: Run `actionbook setup` (install Skills for OpenClaw)

Run setup:

```bash
actionbook setup
```

During setup, make sure you install Skills to **OpenClaw global**.

After setup, verify `actionbook` is ready in OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw skills check
```

Also run a quick CLI smoke test before changing OpenClaw browser config:

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search listings tokyo" --domain airbnb.com
```

You should see at least one result with an `ID`.

## Step 3: Disable OpenClaw default browser + force Actionbook for browser work

Disable OpenClaw browser tool and restart gateway:

```bash
openclaw config set browser.enabled false --json
```

Then update `tools.deny` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

- If `tools.deny` is empty/unset, set it to: `"browser"`
- If `tools.deny` already has rules, **append** `"browser"` (do not replace existing entries)

Apply by restarting gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Rollback (if you need to restore built-in browser later):

```bash
openclaw config set browser.enabled true --json
openclaw gateway restart
```

When rolling back, remove only `"browser"` from `tools.deny` and keep any other deny rules.

Then add an instruction in the canonical OpenClaw instruction file `~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md`:

```markdown
## Browser automation preference
- Use Actionbook CLI for all website/browser operations.
- Do not use the built-in OpenClaw browser tool unless explicitly asked.
- Follow: `actionbook search` -> `actionbook get` -> operate.
```

After updating `TOOLS.md`, restart once so the instruction is applied:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Try it

Ask OpenClaw:

```text
Use Actionbook in CLI + Skills mode: search first, then get the most relevant manual, then give me the exact selectors and field values to execute.
```
