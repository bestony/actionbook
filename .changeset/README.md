# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

To add a new changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to select which packages have changed, what type of semver bump (major/minor/patch), and a summary of the changes.

To version packages based on existing changesets:

```bash
pnpm version-packages
```

To publish packages to npm:

```bash
pnpm release
```
